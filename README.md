Only Discord Bot You Need (i guess...) ~ 萌え萌えキュン ♡ (⸝⸝> ᴗ•⸝⸝)

## Features

- **Auto Roles**: Automatically assign (different) roles to users or bots when they join the server.
- **Reaction Roles**: Create reaction roles or add to an existing message. For the reaction message, you can use plain text, markdown or even JSON Data from [Discohook](https://discohook.org/).
- **Honey Pot**: Tired of keeping an eye on compromised accounts? With `/hony_pot` command, you can set up a public channel for such accounts. A clear message will sent to the selected channel to not post anything there. So, most likely, a compromised account will sent a message there (due to it being public) and will get banned and message deleted immedietly. The only limitation there is, it does not delete messages sent to other channels by that compromised account.
- **Welcome & Goodbye**: Sent a customizable message along with the user profile picture when a user (including bot users) joins or leaves the server. The messages and channels can be configured/customized. But, right now, the image can not be customized.


## Current Limitations

For all the server configurations, it uses file based configuration (a JSON file). Which means, it is more likely to get deleted when you host the bot on an actual server. For example, when you update/deploy new version, etc. Regardless, Feel free to change, host the project/bot.

I am hosting (or really "running") the original bot on my phone using "Termux". Please consider supporting me on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cheapnightbot). And If you would like to use the original bot, you can invite it using the following link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1326853669089574952
